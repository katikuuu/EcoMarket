                A report by Trove Research revealed that thereâ€™s a total of $36
                billion invested in carbon credit projects from 2012 to 2022,
                accelerating with more than $18 billion raised in the last 2.5
                years. But global efforts are still short of $90 billion to meet
                the 2030 carbon reduction targets.

              <p>
                Investments in developing carbon credit projects are an
                important market signal indicating levels of corporate climate

                However excessive criticism of quality may deter companies from
                engaging in their voluntary commitment to support carbon
                credits. This, in turn, may undermine critical voluntary climate
                actions from large companies.{" "}

                The new commitment will deliver over a thousand new carbon
                projects, ranging from forest protection to carbon capture and
                storage solutions. It will also provide a growing supply of
                carbon credits that companies can use for their net zero
                strategies.
